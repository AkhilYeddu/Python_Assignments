A. Age Distribution and Product Purchase:
1)Use histograms or density plots to visualize the age distribution.
2)Create cross-tabulations or boxplots to see how age relates to product purchase (ProdTaken).
3)Calculate purchase rates by age group to identify potential target demographics.

B. Contact Type and Purchase Likelihood:
1)Analyze purchase rates across different contact types (e.g., phone, email, web).
2)Use Chi-square tests to determine if there's a statistically significant association between contact type and purchase.

C. City Tier and Monthly Income:
1)Calculate average monthly income for each city tier.
2)Visualize the relationship with scatter plots or boxplots.
3)Look for trends or patterns in income distribution across city tiers.

D. Pitch Duration and Product Purchase:
1)Compare average pitch durations between customers who purchased and those who didn't.
2)Use boxplots or violin plots to understand the distribution of pitch durations for both groups.

E. Occupation Distribution and Purchase:
1)Analyze the distribution of occupation types among customers.
2)Create contingency tables or bar charts to visualize the breakdown.
3)Calculate purchase rates by occupation and identify any groups more likely to purchase.

F. Gender-Based Product Preferences:
1)Analyze the distribution of product types pitched (ProductPitched) across genders.
2)Use stacked bar charts or conditional formatting to visualize potential gender-based preferences.

G. Number of Trips and Purchase Likelihood:
1)Explore the relationship between the number of trips taken (number of trips) and product purchase using scatter 2)plots or correlation analysis.
3)Calculate purchase rates by trip frequency to identify potential customer segments.

H. Passport Ownership and Travel Behavior:
1)Analyze the number of trips taken and product purchase rates for customers with and without passports.
2)Use Chi-square tests to check for significant associations between passport ownership and travel behavior/purchase

I. Pitch Satisfaction and Purchase:
1)Investigate the distribution of pitch satisfaction scores.
2)Analyze purchase rates across different satisfaction score ranges.
3)Look for trends suggesting a link between satisfaction and purchase decisions.

J. Number of Children and Product Purchase:
1)Analyze purchase rates across different numbers of children visiting.
2)Use boxplots or violin plots to compare trip frequencies for customers with varying numbers of children.

K. Gender and Product Preferences:
1)Create contingency tables to see how gender distribution varies across product types pitched (ProductPitched).
2)Use Chi-square tests to check for significant associations between gender and preferred product types.

L. Marital Status and Product Purchase:
1)Analyze purchase rates by marital status.
2)Create contingency tables to see if specific marital statuses correlate with certain travel product choices (ProdTaken).

M. Number of Children and Purchase Interest:
1)investigate purchase rates based on the number of children visiting.

N. Car Ownership and Travel Decisions:
1)Analyze the number of trips taken and product purchase rates for car owners vs. non-owners.
2)Use Chi-square tests to see if car ownership is associated with travel behavior/purchase.

O. Income Level and Product Choice:
1)Analyze purchase rates for different product types across various income levels.
2)Use boxplots or violin plots to explore potential trends in product preference based on monthly income
